# Platformer Project

This project was carried out as part of a course on Human-Computer Interface. We were two people working on this project.

## Description

This project is a 2D platformer developed using Unity. The project focuses primarly on game mechanics and feedbacks. The main difficulty of this project was the prohibition on using Rigidbody physics, and therefore the need to recode the collision system.

## Controls and features

![Controls](https://zupimages.net/up/23/24/rr4e.png)

Yellow platforms are regular platforms and they can not be crossed.
Green platforms are bouncing platforms.
Red platforms are damage platforms.
Blue platforms are slow-moving platforms.
Pink platforms are platforms that can be crossed.

## Feedbacks implemented

- A loading bar for jumping ;
- The cube turns red a few seconds when it takes damage ;
- The dust particles during jump and dash ;
- The number of player hit points displayed in the top left-hand corner of the screen ;
- The "Start" sign in the game start area ;
- The victory and defeat menus ;
- The sounds when player takes damage ;
- The sound when the player reaches the goal.

## Potential improvements
The main thing we could improve in this game is the implementation of the collisions. Too often the player can go through walls or through platforms.
